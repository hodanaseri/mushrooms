This repository contains a dataset for classifying mushrooms into edible and poisonous categories based on various features. The dataset is ideal for practicing machine learning classification techniques, especially for those interested in biological data and environmental studies. This dataset is available at [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom)
## Dataset Description
The dataset includes various attributes related to different mushroom species, including:
- **Cap Shape**
- **Cap Surface**
- **Cap Color**
- **Odor**
- **Gill Attachment**
- **Gill Color**
- **Stalk Shape**
- **Stalk Color**
- **Spore Print Color**
- **Habitat**

-Each mushroom is labeled as either **edible** or **poisonous**, making it a binary classification problem.
### Data Format
- **Format:** CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Number of Instances:** 8,124
- **Number of Attributes:** 22 (including the class label)
## Getting Started
### Requirements
